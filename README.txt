Final Assignment:
In this assignment, I am happy to say that I was able to complete the war card game as a command window interface game. However, I was not able to fully complete the GUI portion to the extent I would have liked. However, while I didn’t finish the GUI, the core systems for it are demonstrated in my WarGUI file. This includes a working “Play” button, and active card flipping. Resizing and arranging the cards was also a problem that I am aware of, but the cards are still capable of flipping.

Files included:

Card.java
War.java — Fully functional command window game
